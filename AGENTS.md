## Yomitan Edit Workflow

- Do not edit built/compiled files under `GSM_Overlay/yomitan/` directly.
- For Yomitan logic changes, edit source files in `C:\Users\Beangate\GSM\yomitan-gsm\ext\` (for example: `ext/js/language/text-scanner.js`).
- After source edits, rebuild and sync the overlay copy by running:
  - `C:\Users\Beangate\GSM\yomitan-gsm\local-build-chrome-overlay.ps1`
