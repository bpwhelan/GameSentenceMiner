## Features

### Anki Card Enhancement

GSM significantly enhances your Anki cards with rich contextual information:

* **Automated Audio Capture**: Automatically records the voice line associated with the text.

  * **Automatic Trim**: Some simple math around the time that the text event came in, in combination with a "Voice Activation Detection" (VAD) library gives us neatly cut audio.
  * **Manual Trim**: If Automatic voiceline trim is not perfect, it's possible to [open the audio in an external program](https://youtu.be/LKFQFy2Qm64) for trimming.

* **Screenshot**: Captures a screenshot of the game at the moment the voice line is spoken.

* **Multi-Line**: It's possible to capture multiple lines at once with sentence audio with GSM's very own Texthooker.

* **AI Translation**: Integrates AI to provide quick translations of the captured sentence. Custom Prompts also supported. (Optional, Bring your own Key)

### OCR

GSM runs a fork of [OwOCR](https://github.com/AuroraWright/owocr/) to provide accurate text capture from games that do not have a hook. Here are some improvements GSM makes on stock OwOCR:

* **Easier Setup**: With GSM's managed Python install, setup is only a matter of clicking a few buttons.

* **Exclusion Zones**: Instead of choosing an area to OCR, you can choose an area to exclude from OCR. Useful if you have a static interface in your game and text appears randomly throughout.

* **Two-Pass OCR**: To cut down on API calls and keep output clean, GSM features a "Two-Pass" OCR System. A Local OCR will be constantly running, and when the text on screen stabilizes, it will run a second, more accurate scan that gets sent to clipboard/WebSocket.

* **Consistent Audio Timing**: With the two-pass system, we can still get accurate audio recorded and into Anki without the use of crazy offsets or hacks.

* **More Language Support**: Stock OwOCR is hard-coded to Japanese, while in GSM you can use a variety of languages.

### Game Launcher Capabilities (WIP)

This is probably the feature I care least about, but if you are lazy like me, you may find this helpful.

* **Launch**:  GSM can launch your games directly, simplifying the setup process.

* **Hook**:  Streamlines the process of hooking your games (Agent).

This feature simplifies the process of launching games and (potentially) hooking them, making the entire workflow more efficient.

## Basic Requirements

* **Anki card creation tool**: [Yomitan](https://github.com/yomidevs/yomitan), [JL](https://github.com/rampaa/JL), etc.

* **A method of getting text from the game**: [Agent](https://github.com/0xDC00/agent), [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor), [LunaTranslator](https://github.com/HIllya51/LunaTranslator), GSM's OCR, etc.

* **A game :)**

## FAQ

### How Does It Work?

This is a common question, and understanding this process will help clarify any issues you might encounter while using GSM.

1.  The beginning of the voice line is marked by a text event. This usually comes from Textractor, Agent, or another texthooker. GSM can listen for a clipboard copy and/or a WebSocket server (configurable in GSM).

2.  The end of the voice line is detected using a Voice Activity Detection (VAD) library running locally. ([Example](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad))

In essence, GSM relies on accurately timed text events to capture the corresponding audio.

GSM provides settings to accommodate less-than-ideal hooks. However, if you experience significant audio inconsistencies, they likely stem from a poorly timed hook, loud background music, or other external factors, rather than GSM itself. The core audio trimming logic has been stable and effective for many users across various games.
